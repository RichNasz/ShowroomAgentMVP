# ShowroomAgentMVP - Team Installation Instructions

**Quick Installation Guide for Internal Users**

## Quick Start (2 Simple Steps)

### Step 1: Download
Download `ShowroomAgentMVP-unsigned.zip` from your team's shared location or distribution point.

### Step 2: Install & Run
1. **Extract**: Double-click the ZIP file to extract `ShowroomAgentMVP.app`
2. **First Launch**: Right-click on `ShowroomAgentMVP.app` â†’ Select "Open"
3. **Security Dialog**: Click "Open" in the macOS security warning dialog
4. **Done**: The app will launch and work normally from now on

## That's It! ðŸŽ‰

After this one-time security approval:
- âœ… Double-click the app to launch it normally (no more right-clicking needed)
- âœ… Move it to your Applications folder if desired
- âœ… Create a dock shortcut for quick access
- âœ… App will receive automatic updates through normal distribution channels

## About the App

**ShowroomAgentMVP** is an AI-powered content generation tool that:
- Transforms technical documentation into engaging blog posts
- Generates social media content from GitHub repositories
- Uses structured Antora documentation as source material
- Integrates with various LLM providers (OpenAI, local Ollama, etc.)

## System Requirements

- **macOS**: 15.0 (macOS Sequoia) or later
- **Storage**: ~50MB for the application
- **Network**: Internet connection for GitHub repository access and LLM services
- **Permissions**: The app will request folder access permissions when needed

## Why Right-Click "Open"?

Since this is an internal company application (not distributed through the Mac App Store), macOS Gatekeeper shows a security warning the first time you launch it. Using right-click â†’ "Open" bypasses the stricter security check that prevents double-clicking unsigned apps.

**This is normal and safe** - it's standard procedure for internal company software.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Problem**: "Cannot open because it is from an unidentified developer"
**Solution**: Make sure you right-clicked and selected "Open" (don't double-click the first time)

**Problem**: App won't open after moving to Applications folder
**Solution**: Right-click â†’ "Open" again after moving to complete the security approval

**Problem**: App asks for folder permissions
**Solution**: This is normal - grant access to folders where you want to store projects and generated content

**Problem**: App won't connect to GitHub or LLM services
**Solution**: Check your network connection and verify any API keys are configured correctly

**Problem**: Still having issues or need help?
**Contact**: Your IT support team or the application administrator
